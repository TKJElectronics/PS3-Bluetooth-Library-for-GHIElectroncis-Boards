This code is no longer maintained, but fell free to fork the repository. 
Instead I focused on bluetooth support for the Arduino platform, as it will come to good use to more people. See my other repository for more details: https://github.com/TKJElectronics/USB_Host_Shield_2.0.

It works with all boards from GHIElectronics with USB Host functionality - FEZ Panda, FEZ Rhino etc.
All three PS3 Controllers are supported (Dualshock 3-, Navigation-, and Motioncontroller).

I have also uploaded several videos of it in action. Check out our youtube channel for details: http://www.youtube.com/mindthomas
